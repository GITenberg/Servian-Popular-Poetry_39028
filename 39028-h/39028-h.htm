<h2><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vii</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the middle of the seventh
century, a number of Slavonian tribes stretched themselves along
the Sava and the Danube, down to the Black Sea, and founded, at
different times, no less than six separate kingdoms, those of
Bulgaria, Croatia, Servia, Bosnia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia; under
the name <i>Srb</i>, the four last of these nations must be
considered as comprised.&nbsp; <a name="pageviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. viii</span>Their earlier history it is not
easy to trace.&nbsp; Slavonian writers are disposed to represent
the Maestid&aelig;, who made an incursion into Italy during the
age of Claudius Tacitus (A.D. 276), as synonymous with the
Sarmat&aelig;; and Kopitar (a high authority) has gathered much
evidence to prove that the dialect spoken in the district to the
east of Sparta is of Slavonic origin.&nbsp; Leake has remarked,
that many of the names of places in the Morea are
Slavonian,&mdash;Kastanika, Sitina, Gorica, and others.&nbsp; In
the neighbourhood of Sparta is a town called
&Sigma;&eta;&lambda;&alpha;&phi;&omicron;&chi;&omega;&rho;&#8054;,
and it is notorious, that the language of several of the islands
of the Grecian Archipelago, Hydra for example, is Slavonic.&nbsp;
The original meaning of the word <i>Srb</i>, it is not <a
name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. ix</span>easy to
fix.&nbsp; Some derive it from <i>Srp</i>, a <i>sickle</i>,
<i>others from Sibir</i>, <i>Sever</i>, <i>the north</i>; others
from <i>Sarmat</i>, or <i>Sarmatian</i>; some from the Latin
<i>Servus</i>; but Dobrowsky says, &ldquo;Significatum radicis
<i>Srb</i>, consultis etiam dialectis omnibus, nondum licuit
eruere.&rdquo; <a name="citation0a"></a><a href="#footnote0a"
class="citation">[0a]</a>&nbsp; In the year 640, the Servians
built, with the permission of Heraclius, the city of Servica, on
the banks of the Danube.&nbsp; Little can be traced of their
history till, under Vlastimir, at the end of the ninth century,
they were the tributaries of the Greeks.&nbsp; At this period,
they appear to have been engaged in wars with the Bulgarians,
whom they subdued.&nbsp; At the beginning <a
name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>of the 11th
century, Vladimir assumed the title of king of Servia.&nbsp;
Afterwards, during the reign of Tzedomil, the Servians
acknowledged the Roman authority, and leagued themselves with its
emperors against Comnenus the Grecian monarch, in consequence of
which Comnenus marched upon Servia (in 1151), subdued its
inhabitants, and led their leader Tzedomil into captivity.&nbsp;
The submission of the latter obtained his release; but the
Servians, impatient of foreign control, made another attempt to
free themselves, but were defeated on the banks of the Morava, by
Isaac Angelos, in 1192, when Stephen Nemana was proclaimed
monarch, with the title of <i>Despot</i>.&nbsp; His successor,
Stephen <a name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xi</span>Nemanich, was driven from his throne by the Hungarians,
and his brother Vuk Nemanich was proclaimed king or <i>Kral</i>
of Servia, under Hungarian authority.&nbsp; He reigned for a very
short period, and the regal power again reverted to
Stephen.&nbsp; At this period, however, separate from, and almost
independent of monarchical authority, a number of dukes, princes,
and <i>Bans</i>, exercised a sway in Servia; Bosnia, then called
Rama, South Bosnia or Herzegovina, and Rascia, that part of
southern Servia, through which the river Raska flows, were
frequently detached from, and as frequently re-united to Servia
proper.&nbsp; Milutin Urosh, who reigned from 1275 to 1321, was
subdued <a name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xii</span>by Charles the First of Hungaria.&nbsp; Soon after
arose the monarch who is one of the most illustrious names in
Servian song and Servian story, Dushan Silni (Dushan the mighty),
who carried on several successful campaigns against the Greeks,
and recovered many of the lost provinces of his country.&nbsp; He
took the title of Tzar, <a name="citation0b"></a><a
href="#footnote0b" class="citation">[0b]</a> and was succeeded by
that ill-fated Lazar, whose defeat by the sultan Murad (Amurath),
on the field of Kosova (June 15, 1389), is the subject of so many
of the melancholy ballads of the Servians.&nbsp; Murad was
stabbed by the Servian Molosh <a name="pagexiii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>Obilich, and Lazar was executed in
the Mussulmans&rsquo; camp.&nbsp; Murad&rsquo;s brother
(Bajazet), divided Servia between the two sons of Lazar, who did
homage and paid heavy tribute.&nbsp; Since then, no dawn of
liberty has shone upon Servia.&nbsp; Reduced to be the bloody
theatre of the fierce wars which have been carried on between the
Turks and Hungarians, every struggle for freedom&mdash;each
feebler than the former one, has only served to deteriorate her
condition, and to destroy her hopes.&nbsp; In 1459, Servia was
treated solely as a conquered province,&mdash;her most
respectable families banished or destroyed, while, from time to
time, vast numbers of Servians emigrated into Hungary.&nbsp; In
1481, prince <a name="pagexiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xiv</span>Pavo Brankovich made an irruption into Servia, and
after defeating the Turks in several battles, headed 50,000
Servians, who fixed themselves as colonists under the protection
of Hungary.&nbsp; In 1689, many thousand Servians flocked to the
army of Leopold the First.&nbsp; The following year, the
patriarch Tzernovich led into Sirmia and Slavonia nearly sixty
thousand Servian families.&nbsp; By the treaty of Passarovich, in
1718, the greater part of Servia was transferred to the
Austrians.&nbsp; It reverted back to the Porte in 1739.&nbsp; In
1759, a vast number of Servians emigrated into Russia, and
peopled Newservia, but they have since been completely blended
with the Russians, whose language they soon adopted.&nbsp; At <a
name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xv</span>the beginning
of the present century, Servia was again released from the
Turkish sway, and under the auspices of the Austrian emperor, is
now governed by a <i>Knes</i>, or prince, whose name is Milosh
Obrenowich. <a name="citation0c"></a><a href="#footnote0c"
class="citation">[0c]</a></p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="pagexvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>There
are four provinces or governments (Sandshaks), Semendria,
Perserin, Veltshterin, and Aladshahissar, consisting of nearly a
million of Servians, subjected to Turkish authority.&nbsp; The
greater part of these are Christians of the Greek Church.&nbsp;
The number of Servians who recognise the <i>Greek Church</i> is
estimated by Schaffarik at 2,526,000. <a name="citation0d"></a><a
href="#footnote0d" class="citation">[0d]</a></p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The various idioms of the Slavonian language may, without
exception, be traced up to one single stem, the old or church <a
name="pagexvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xvii</span>Slavonic.&nbsp; From this one source, two great
streams flow forth; the northern, comprehending the Bohemian,
Polish, and Russian; and the southern, composed of the Hungarian,
Bulgarian, and Servian tongues.&nbsp; The latter branches were
much less extensively employed than the former.&nbsp; About a
million and a half of men speak the Hungarian; not more than half
a million the Bulgarian, which in Macedonia has been superseded
by the Romaic, the Albanian, and the Turkish; while the Servian
idiom, the most cultivated, the most interesting, and the most
widely spread of all the southern Slavonian dialects, is the
language of about five millions, <a name="pagexviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xviii</span>of whom about two millions are
Mahommedans. <a name="citation0e"></a><a href="#footnote0e"
class="citation">[0e]</a></p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The vicinity of Greece and Italy modified and mellowed the
language of Servia, which is, in fact, the Russian hellenized,
deprived of its hardiness and its consonant terminations, and
softened down into a perfect instrument for poetry and music. <a
name="citation0f"></a><a href="#footnote0f"
class="citation">[0f]</a>&nbsp; Of the descendants from the
ancient Slavonic, it is more closely allied to the Russian and <a
name="pagexix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xix</span>Windish
idioms, than to the Bohemian or Polish.&nbsp; Vuk Karadjich
divides it into three distinct dialects, the
<i>Herzegovinian</i>, or that spoken in Bosnia, Montenegro,
Dalmatia, and Croatia; the <i>Sirmian</i>, which is used in
Sirmia and Slavonian and the <i>Resavian</i>.&nbsp; No doubt the
Servian language has been considerably influenced by the Turkish,
but though it has been enriched by oriental words, it has not
adopted an oriental construction.&nbsp; Schaffarik, in describing
the different Slavonic tongues, says, fancifully but truly, that
&ldquo;Servian song resembles the tune of the violin; Old
Slavonian, that of the organ; Polish, that of the guitar.&nbsp;
The Old Slavonian in its psalms, sounds like the loud rush of the
<a name="pagexx"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xx</span>mountain
stream; the Polish, like the bubbling and sparkling of a
fountain; and the Servian like the quiet murmuring of a streamlet
in the valley.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Servian alphabet consists of only twenty-eight letters,
which is twenty less than the old Slavonic, and seven less than
the Russian.&nbsp; The letters &#1066; (dj), &#1026; (tj), and
&#1039; the soft g of the Italians, are unknown to the Russians,
and the Servians have added two letters to their alphabet, by
combining the &#1068; of the Russians with &#1040; and &#1053;,
making &#1033; and &#1034;, which are equivalent to the Italian
gl and gn, the Spanish ll and &ntilde;, and the Portuguese lh and
nh.&nbsp; They have wholly dismissed <a name="pagexxi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxi</span>the &#1041;, which so constantly and
so uselessly occurs in the church Slavonic and Russian.</p>
<p>No traces of Servian literature go beyond the thirteenth
century. <a name="citation0g"></a><a href="#footnote0g"
class="citation">[0g]</a>&nbsp; The Hexaemeron of Basil, the
Bulgarian exarch, written in 1263, and the Epistle of Damian, in
1324, are both in the old church Slavonian tongue.&nbsp; The
first Servian literary record is the <i>Rodoslov</i> of Daniel,
archbishop of Servia, which is a chronicle of the four kings who
were his contemporaries (from 1272 to 1336), beginning with
Urosh.&nbsp; This book is a valuable register of the laws enacted
during his life, and throws much light on early Servian
history.&nbsp; An almanack, entitled <i>Ljetopis</i>, of this
period, also exists; and of a somewhat later period, the
<i>Tzarostavnik</i>, or <i>Register of Princes</i>, by an unknown
author.&nbsp; Dushan, with whose name the Servians associate all
that is glorious, caused a book of laws to be written for the use
of his kingdom, which breathe a milder and kinder spirit than
would be <a name="pagexxiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxiii</span>expected in an age and among a people so little
instructed.&nbsp; They contain some remarkable provisions in
favour of travellers and strangers; and not only compel
hospitality, but protect property, by making the host responsible
for its security.&nbsp; The battle of Kosova introduced a long
night of darkness and desolation into Servia; and though a few
religious books were published soon after the invention of
printing, no one work of the slightest interest appeared till the
end of the 17th century, when George Brankovich, <a
name="citation0h"></a><a href="#footnote0h"
class="citation">[0h]</a> the <a name="pagexxiv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxiv</span>last of the Servian <i>despots</i>,
wrote a history of Servia, bringing it down to the time of
Leopold the First.&nbsp; In 1758, Demetrius Theodosijev
established a Servian press.&nbsp; In 1796, the Austrian
government granted a monopoly of all Servian literature to the
university of Ofen, by suppressing all printing-presses
elsewhere.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="pagexxv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxv</span>Though it is not my intention to write a general
history of the literature of Servia, in introducing one
interesting branch of it to the English reader, I cannot but
slightly refer to the essential services it has received from a
few distinguished writers.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>John Raich</i> was born in Karlovitz in 1726, and died in
1801.&nbsp; He received his elementary education from the Jesuits
in Komorn, removed to the evangelical school at Oedenburg, and
completed his studies at Kiev.&nbsp; He afterwards visited the
famous convent of Chilendar (on Mount Athos), which was built and
endowed by Shupan Nemana, who died there as a monk, having taken
the name of Simeon.&nbsp; <a name="pagexxvi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxvi</span>Raich was ultimately chosen
archimandrite of the convent of Kovil, in Chaskisten
bataillon.&nbsp; His principal work, printed at Vienna
(1792&ndash;5), is his history of the Slavonian people. <a
name="citation0i"></a><a href="#footnote0i"
class="citation">[0i]</a>&nbsp; He also wrote a history of
Servia, Rasza, Bosnia, and Rama (Vienna, 1793); a tragedy on the
death of the Tzar Urosh (Ofen, 1798); and many theological
treatises.&nbsp; He uses the church Slavonian dialect, but his
style is full of Servian and Russian phraseology, which he
perhaps adopted as likely to recommend his productions.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="pagexxvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxvii</span><i>Dosithei Obradovich</i>, who was born in 1739, and
died in 1811, was the first who ventured to apply the popular
language to the purposes of literature.&nbsp; His birth-place was
Chakovo in the <i>Banat</i> of Temeshvar, and at the age of
fourteen he became a monk in the Opovo convent.&nbsp; Here he was
too restless to remain, and having determined to see foreign
countries, he travelled for a quarter of a century, and visited
Greece, Albania, Italy, Turkey, Russia, Germany, France, and
England.&nbsp; The love of home had mastered the desire of
change, and he returned to Servia, when he was made a senator at
Belgrad, and appointed to superintend the education of the
children of Tzerny George.&nbsp; He published <a
name="pagexxviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxviii</span>at
Leipzig, in 1783, an auto-biography, entitled &ldquo;<i>Tzivot i
prikliuchenjia D. Obranovicza</i>,&rdquo; besides sundry poems
and fables, and moral treatises.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Demetrius Davidovich</i> has greatly assisted in elevating
the language of the Servian people to the best purposes of
literary instruction.&nbsp; He is (I believe at this time) the
secretary to Milosh, the hospodar of Servia.&nbsp; For many years
he edited a Servian newspaper at Vienna, and has annually
published a Servian almanack (<i>Zabavnik</i>), in which are many
interesting particulars respecting the literary and political
history of his country.&nbsp; The indisposition on the part of
the superintendents of schools in <a name="pagexxix"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxix</span>Servia, to employ the popular
tongue as the instrument of education, has been long the ban of
civilization, and the barrier to national improvement.&nbsp; But
of late the influence of those who have endeavoured to make
literature subserve the interests and the happiness of the many
rather than the few, has led to the dismissal of Slavonian, and
the substitution of Servian books.&nbsp; A controversy, with much
controversial bitterness, is at the present moment carried on in
Servia (where, as elsewhere, to be dignified is by some thought
better than to be useful, and to please a few pedants is deemed
more worthy of ambition than to instruct a whole people), between
the advocates of the antiquated Slavonic, and <a
name="pagexxx"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxx</span>those whose
simple and intelligible maxim is, &ldquo;write as you speak, if
you would be understood;&rdquo; and of the latter every year adds
greatly to the numbers.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>But of all the writers of Servia, he from whom the volumes
emanate whence these translations are taken, is beyond comparison
the most attractive and the most popular.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Stephanovich Karadjich Vuk</i> was born on the 26th
October, O. S., in the year 1787, at <i>Trshich</i>, an obscure
village in Turkish Servia (Iadar), near the town of Losnitza and
the river Drina, at a short distance from the Austrian and
Hungarian <a name="pagexxxi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxi</span>frontier, where, however, the Servian language is
spoken with far more purity than in the larger towns.&nbsp; In
his early youth he passed the borders, and received his education
at the Gymnasium of the dissidents from the Greek church at
Karlovitz.&nbsp; There his school instruction began and ended;
but having visited Vienna, intercourse there with intelligent and
instructed men led to the development of the natural powers of
his mind, and directed his inquiries to the hidden stores of
popular literature which his country possessed.&nbsp; A feeble
and crippled frame unfitted him for bodily labour, and all his
thoughts and all his ardour attached themselves to intellectual
exertions.&nbsp; He began his literary <a
name="pagexxxii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxxii</span>career
at Vienna, and published in 1814 his Servian Grammar, and a
century of Servian songs; but the embarrassments of the
censorship induced him to seek a freer field for the publication
of his works, and he removed to Leipzig, where the edition, in
three volumes, of his popular Servian poetry, appeared in
1823&ndash;4.&nbsp; He soon obtained high reputation there, and
received the diploma of doctor in philosophy, and was elected to
many literary distinctions.&nbsp; The emperor Nicholas, in that
spirit so honourable to many of the autocrats of Russia, has
conferred on him a yearly pension of 100 ducats; and he now
pursues his interesting inquiries, and from time to time exerts
that creating and regenerating <a name="pagexxxiii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxxiii</span>power which has called the poetry
of Servia into existence, and established for it a permanent
reputation. <a name="citation0j"></a><a href="#footnote0j"
class="citation">[0j]</a></p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Servians must be reckoned among those races who vibrated
between the north and the east; possessing to-day, dispossessed
to-morrow; now fixed, and now <a name="pagexxxiv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxxiv</span>wandering: having their
head-quarters in Sarmatia for many generations, in Macedonia for
following ones, and settling in Servia at last.&nbsp; But to
trace their history, as to trace their course, is
impossible.&nbsp; At last the eye fixes them between the Sava and
the Danube, and Belgrade grows up as the central point round
which the power of Servia gathers itself together, and stretches
itself along the right bank of the former river, southwards to
the range of mountains which spread to the Adriatic and to the
verge of Montengro.&nbsp; Looking yet closer, we observe the
influence of the Venetians and the Hungarians on the character
and the literature of the Servians.&nbsp; We track their
connexion now as allies, and <a name="pagexxxv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxxv</span>now as masters; once the receivers
of tribute from, and anon as tributaries to, the Grecian empire;
and in more modern times the slaves of the Turkish yoke.&nbsp;
Every species of vicissitude marks the Servian
annals,&mdash;annals represented only by those poetical
productions of which these are specimens.&nbsp; The question of
their veracity is a far more interesting one than that of their
antiquity.&nbsp; Few of them narrate events previous to the
invasion of Europe by the Turks in 1355, but some refer to facts
coeval with the Mussulman empire in Adrianople.&nbsp; More
numerous are the records of the struggle between the Moslem and
the Christian parties at a later period; and last of all, they
represent the quiet and friendly intercourse <a
name="pagexxxvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxxvi</span>between
the two religions, if not blended in social affections, at least
associated in constant communion. <a name="citation0k"></a><a
href="#footnote0k" class="citation">[0k]</a></p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The earliest poetry of the Servians has a heathenish
character; <a name="citation0l"></a><a href="#footnote0l"
class="citation">[0l]</a> that which follows is leagued with
Christian legends.&nbsp; But holy deeds are always made the
condition of salvation.&nbsp; The whole nation, to use the <a
name="pagexxxvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxxvii</span>idea
of G&ouml;the, is imaged in poetical superstition.&nbsp; Events
are brought about by the agency of angels, but the footsteps of
Satan can be nowhere traced;&mdash;the dead are often summoned
from their tombs;&mdash;awful warnings, prophecies, and birds of
evil omen, bear terror to the minds of the most courageous.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Over all is spread the influence of a remarkable and, no
doubt, antique mythology.&nbsp; An omnipresent spirit&mdash;airy
and fanciful&mdash;making its dwelling in solitudes&mdash;and
ruling over mountains and forests&mdash;a being called the
<i>Vila</i>, is heard to issue its irresistible mandates, and
pour forth its prophetic inspiration: sometimes in a <a
name="pagexxxviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxviii</span>form of female beauty&mdash;sometimes a wilder
Diana&mdash;now a goddess gathering or dispersing the clouds, and
now an owl among ruins and ivy.&nbsp; The Vila, always
capricious, and frequently malevolent, is a most important actor
in all the popular poetry of Servia.&nbsp; The <i>Trica
polonica</i> is sacred to her.&nbsp; She is equally renowned for
the beauty of her person and the swiftness of her
step:&mdash;&ldquo;Fair as the mountain Vila,&rdquo; is the
highest compliment to a Servian lady&mdash;&ldquo;Swift as the
Vila,&rdquo; is the most eloquent eulogium on a Servian
steed.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Of the amatory poems of the Servians, G&ouml;the justly
remarks, that, when viewed all together, they cannot but be
deemed of <a name="pagexxxix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxix</span>singular beauty; they exhibit the expressions of
passionate, overflowing, and contented affection; they are full
of shrewdness and spirit; delight and surprise are admirably
pourtrayed; and there is, in all, a marvellous sagacity in
subduing difficulties and in obtaining an end; a natural, but at
the same time vigorous and energetic tone; sympathies and
sensibilities, without wordy exaggeration, but which,
notwithstanding, are decorated with poetical imagery and
imaginative beauty; a correct picture of Servian life and
manners,&mdash;everything, in short, which gives to passion the
force of truth, and to external scenery the character of
reality.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="pagexl"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xl</span>The
poetry of Servia was wholly traditional, until within a very few
years.&nbsp; It had never found a pen to record it, but has been
preserved by the people, and principally by those of the lower
classes, who had been accustomed to listen and to sing these
interesting compositions to the sound of a simple three-stringed
instrument, called a <i>Gusle</i>; and it is mentioned by
G&ouml;the, that when some Servians who had visited Vienna were
requested to write down the songs they had sung, they expressed
the greatest surprise that such simple poetry and music as theirs
should possess any interest for intelligent and cultivated
minds.&nbsp; They apprehended, they said, that the <a
name="pagexli"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xli</span>artless
compositions of their country would be the subject of scorn or
ridicule to those whose poetry was so polished and so
sublime.&nbsp; And this feeling must have been ministered to by
the employment, even in Servia, of a language no longer spoken,
for the productions of literature, though it is certain the
natural affections, the everyday thoughts and associations could
not find fit expression in the old church dialect:</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The
talk<br />
Man holds with week-day man in the hourly walk<br />
Of the mind&rsquo;s business, is the undoubted stalk<br />
&ldquo;<i>True song</i>&rdquo; doth grow on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The collection of popular songs, <i>Narodne </i><a
name="pagexlii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xlii</span><i>srpske
pjesme</i>, from which most of those which occupy this volume are
taken, was made by Vuk, and committed to paper either from early
recollections, or from the repetition of Servian minstrels.&nbsp;
These, he informs us, and his statement is corroborated by every
intelligent traveller, form a very small portion of the treasure
of song which exists unrecorded among the peasantry.&nbsp; How so
much of beautiful anonymous poetry should have been created in so
perfect a form, is a subject well worthy of inquiry.&nbsp; Among
a people who look to music and song as a source of enjoyment, the
habit of improvisation grows up imperceptibly, and engages all
the fertilities of imagination in its exercise.&nbsp; The thought
<a name="pagexliii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xliii</span>which first finds vent in a poetical form, if worth
preservation, is polished and perfected as it passes from lip to
lip, till it receives the stamp of popular approval, and becomes
as it were a national possession.&nbsp; There is no text-book, no
authentic record, to which it can be referred, whose authority
should interfere with its improvement.&nbsp; The poetry of a
people is a common inheritance, which one generation transfers
sanctioned and amended to another.&nbsp; Political adversity,
too, strengthens the attachment of a nation to the records of its
ancient prosperous days.&nbsp; The harps may be hung on the
willows for a while, during the storm and the struggle, but when
the tumult is over, they will be strung again to <a
name="pagexliv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xliv</span>repeat
the old songs, and recall the time gone by.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The historical ballads, which are in lines composed of five
trochaics, are always sung with the accompaniment of the
<i>Gusle</i>.&nbsp; At the end of every verse, the singer drops
his voice, and mutters a short cadence.&nbsp; The emphatic
passages are chanted in a louder tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot
describe,&rdquo; says Wessely, &ldquo;the pathos with which these
songs are sometimes sung.&nbsp; I have witnessed crowds
surrounding a blind old singer, and every cheek was wet with
tears&mdash;it was not the music, it was the words which affected
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; As this simple instrument, the Gusle, is never
used but to accompany the <a name="pagexlv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xlv</span>poetry of the Servians, and as it is
difficult to find a Servian who does not play upon it, the
universality of their popular ballads may be well imagined.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Independently of the measure of ten syllables, universally
used in the ballads of the Servians, they have verses of seven
syllables, consisting of two trochaics and one dactyl:</p>
<p class="poetry">W&#301;lt tho&#365; l&#333;ve thy&#774;
M&#299;l&#301;tz&#259;?</p>
<p>Of eight syllables, consisting of four trochaics: as,</p>
<p class="poetry">H&#257;st&#259;n &#333;nw&#259;rd t&#333;
th&#283; w&#275;dd&#301;ng.</p>
<p>And of one trochaic between two dactyls:</p>
<p class="poetry">M&#275;rr&#301;ly&#774;, d&#257;nc&#301;ng,
m&#275;rr&#301;ly&#774;.</p>
<p><a name="pagexlvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xlvi</span>Of
ten syllables, two trochaics and two dactyls:</p>
<p class="poetry">M&#333;r&#259;v&#259;&rsquo;s b&#257;nks
&#259;re tr&#333;d by&#774; th&#283; m&#257;id&#277;n.</p>
<p>Of twelve syllables, composed of two trochaics and one
iambic:</p>
<p class="poetry">G&#333; th&#283;n, K&#363;m, th&#335;u
l&#333;v&rsquo;d &#335;ne, w&#257;its sh&#283; f&#335;r
th&#275;e.</p>
<p>And of thirteen syllables, namely, four trochaics, a dactyl,
and a closing trochaic:</p>
<p class="poetry">L&#333;ok &#259;ro&#363;nd, th&#335;u
l&#333;v&#283;ly Cr&#275;t&#259;, sm&#299;l&#301;ngly l&#335;ok
r&#333;und.</p>
<p>The translations which have appeared in Germany under the name
of Talvj are the work of an amiable woman (Theresa von Jacob),
who having passed the earlier part of her life in Russia, and
possessing a mind cultivated by literature, and captivated by the
natural beauties of Servian <a name="pagexlvii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xlvii</span>poetry, has most successfully
devoted herself to their diffusion.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Professor Eugenius Wessely, of Vinkovcze in Slavonia, has also
published a small volume of Translations from the Nuptial Songs
of the Servians; <a name="citation0m"></a><a href="#footnote0m"
class="citation">[0m]</a> the renderings have the merit of
perfect fidelity, and his introduction contains many interesting
illustrations of Servian manners.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the following translations I have, in all the narrative
poetry, preserved the original measure.&nbsp; <i>Rhyme</i> is
seldom used by the Servians.&nbsp; It is found in some of the <a
name="pagexlviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xlviii</span>shorter lyrical pieces, in the rendering of which I
have allowed myself some latitude of expression.&nbsp; But the
wish, above all things, to preserve most faithfully the character
of the original, has prevented my introducing many very obvious
decorations, and my veiling many equally obvious defects.&nbsp;
To fidelity, at least, this volume may lay an honest claim.&nbsp;
I have endeavoured to avail myself of all the authors who have
written on the subject, particularly of the valuable criticisms
of Dr. Kopitar in the Vienna <i>Iahrbuch der Litteratur</i>, of
the works of G&ouml;the, Grimm, and Vater.&nbsp; The notes
attached to Talvj&rsquo;s translation I have employed, without
any special reference to them.</p>

Theodore of Stalach, <a name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"

In his Castle Stalach, on Morava;<br />
Pours him out the wine his aged mother.<br />
While the wine-fumes to his head were rising,<br />
Thus his mother spoke unto the hero:</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Son of mine! thou
Theodore of Stalach!<br />
Tell me, wherefore hast thou not espoused thee?<br />
Thou art in thy youthful days of beauty;<br />
In thy dwelling now thine aged mother<br />

&ldquo;God is witness, O my aged mother!<br />
I have roamed through many a land and city,<br />
But I never found the sought-for maiden;<br />
Or, when found the maiden, found I never<br />
Friendly feelings in thy mind towards her;<br />
And where thou hast shown thy friendly feeling,<br />
There I found the maiden false and faithless.<br />
But, as yesterday, at hour of sunset,<br />
I was wandering near Resava&rsquo;s river,<br />
Lo! I glanced on thirty lovely maidens<br />
On its banks their yarn and linen bleaching:<br />
&rsquo;Midst them was the beauteous Iconia,<br />
Fairest daughter of the Prince Milutin,<br />
He the princely sovereign of Resava.<br />
She, indeed, would be a bride to cherish;<br />
She, indeed, were worthy of thy friendship:<br />
But that maiden is betrothed already;<br />
She is promised unto George Ir&#275;n&#275;&mdash;<br />
To Irene, for Sredoi, his kinsman.<br />
But I&rsquo;ll win that maiden&mdash;I will win her,<br />
Or will perish in the deed, my mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

him&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Say not so, my son! the maid is promised;<br />
&rsquo;Tis no jest! she is of monarchs&rsquo; kindred.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">But the hero cared not for his mother:<br />
Loud he called to D&#333;brivi, his servant&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Dobrivi! come hither, trusty servant!<br />
Bring my brown steed forth, and make him ready&mdash;<br />
Make him ready with the silver saddle;<br />
Rein him with the gold-embroider&rsquo;d bridle.&rdquo;<br />
When the steed was ready, forth he hasten&rsquo;d,<br />
Flung him on his back, and spurr&rsquo;d him onward<br />
To the gentle river of Morava,<br />
Flowing through Resava&rsquo;s quiet levels.</p>
<p class="poetry">And he reach&rsquo;d Resava&rsquo;s gentle
river:<br />
There again he saw the thirty maidens&mdash;<br />

Ask&rsquo;d for help; and sped her courteous greeting&mdash;<br

&ldquo;God above be with thee, lovely maiden!&rdquo;<br />

two verdant larches,<br />
And, between, a high and slender fir-tree:<br />
Not two larches were they&mdash;not two larches,<br />
Not a high and slender fir between them&mdash;<br />
They were brothers, children of one mother.<br />
One was Paul; the other brother, Radul.<br />
And, between them, J&#275;litza, their sister.<br />
Cordial was the love her brothers bore her;<br />
Many a token of affection gave her,<br />
Many a splendid gift and many a trifle,<br />
And at last a knife, in silver hafted,<br />
And adorn&rsquo;d with gold, they gave their sister.</p>
<p class="poetry">When the youthful wife of Paul had heard it,<br

Jealousy swell&rsquo;d up within her bosom:<br />
<a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>And she

Of such cursed weeds I know not.&mdash;Did I,<br />
Never would I tell thee of them, never;<br />
For my brothers love me; yes! they love me&mdash;<br />
To their love full many a gift bears witness.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">When Paul&rsquo;s youthful wife had heard her
sister,<br />
To the steed she hastened in the meadow,<br />
Gave the steed a mortal wound, and hurried<br />
To her husband, whom she thus accosted:&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Evil is the love thou bear&rsquo;st thy sister,<br />

She has stabb&rsquo;d thy courser in the meadow.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="poetry">High and loudly then the maid protested,<br />

By my life, and by thy life, I swear it!&rdquo;<br />
And the brother doubted not his sister.<br />
Which when Paul&rsquo;s young wife perceived, at even<br />
To the garden secretly she hasten&rsquo;d,<br />
Wrung the neck of Paul&rsquo;s grey noble falcon,&mdash;<br />
To her husband sped she then and told him:<br />
&ldquo;Evil is the love thou bear&rsquo;st thy sister,<br />
And thy gifts to her are worse than wasted;<br />
Lo! she has destroy&rsquo;d thy favourite falcon.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Paul inquired of Jelitza his sister,<br />
&ldquo;Tell me why, and so may God reward thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">But his sister swore both high and loudly,<br

&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas not I, upon my life, my brother;<br />
On my life and thine, I did not do it!&rdquo;<br />
And the brother still believed his sister.<br />
<a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>When the
youthful bride of Paul discover&rsquo;d<br />
This, she slunk at evening,&mdash;evening&rsquo;s meal-time,<br

Stole the golden knife, and with it murder&rsquo;d,<br />
Murder&rsquo;d her poor infant in the cradle!<br />
And when morning&rsquo;s dawning brought the morning,<br />
She aroused her husband by her screaming<br />
Shrieking woe; she tore her cheeks, exclaiming:<br />
&ldquo;Evil is the love thou bear&rsquo;st thy sister,<br />
And thy gifts to her are worse than wasted;<br />
She has stabb&rsquo;d our infant in the cradle!<br />
Will thine incredulity now doubt me?<br />
Lo! the knife is in thy sister&rsquo;s girdle.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Up sprang Paul, like one possess&rsquo;d by
madness;<br />
To the upper floor he hasten&rsquo;d wildly;<br />
There his sister on her mats was sleeping,<br />
And the golden knife beneath her pillow.<br />
Swift he seized the golden knife,&mdash;and drew it&mdash;<br />
Drew it, panting, from its silver scabbard;&mdash;<br />
It was damp with blood&mdash;&rsquo;twas red and gory!</p>
<p class="poetry">When the noble Paul saw this, he seized
her,&mdash;<br />
<a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Seized her
by her own white hand, and cursed her:<br />
&ldquo;Let the curse of God be on thee, sister!<br />
Thou didst murder, too, my favourite courser;<br />
Thou didst murder, too, my noble falcon;<br />
But thou should&rsquo;st have spared the helpless
baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Higher yet his sister swore, and
louder&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas not I, upon my life, my brother;<br />
On my life, and on thy life, I swear it!<br />
But if thou wilt disregard my swearing,<br />
Take me to the open fields&mdash;the desert;<br />
Bind thy sister to the tails of horses;<br />
Let four horses tear my limbs asunder.&rdquo;<br />
But the brother trusted not his sister:<br />
Furiously he seized her white hand&mdash;bore her<br />
To the distant fields&mdash;the open desert:<br />
To the tails of four fierce steeds he bound her,<br />
And he drove them forth across the desert;&mdash;<br />
But, where&rsquo;er a drop of blood fell from her,<br />
There a flower sprung up,&mdash;a fragrant flow&rsquo;ret;<br />
Where her body fell when dead and mangled,<br />
There a church arose from out the desert.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>Little time was spent, ere fatal sickness<br />
Fell upon Paul&rsquo;s youthful wife;&mdash;the sickness<br />
Nine long years lay on her,&mdash;heavy sickness!<br />
&rsquo;Midst her bones the matted dog-grass sprouted,<br />
And amidst it nestled angry serpents,<br />
Which, though hidden, drank her eyelight&rsquo;s brightness.<br
/>
Then she mourn&rsquo;d her misery&mdash;mourn&rsquo;d
despairing;<br />
Thus she spoke unto her lord and husband:<br />
&ldquo;O convey me, Paul, my lord and husband!<br />
To thy sister&rsquo;s church convey me swiftly;<br />
For that church, perchance, may heal and save me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">So, when Paul had heard his wife&rsquo;s
petition,<br />
To his sister&rsquo;s church he swiftly bore her.<br />
Hardly had they reach&rsquo;d the church&rsquo;s portal,<br />
When a most mysterious voice address&rsquo;d them:<br />
&ldquo;Come not here, young woman! come not hither!<br />
For this church can neither heal nor save thee.&rdquo;<br />
Bitter was her anguish when she heard it;<br />
And her lord the woman thus entreated:<br />
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>&ldquo;In
the name of God! my lord! my husband!<br />
Never, never bear me to our dwelling.<br />
Bind me to the wild steeds&rsquo; tails, and drive them;<br />
Drive them to the immeasurable desert;<br />
Let them tear my wretched limbs asunder.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Paul then listened to his wife&rsquo;s
entreaties:<br />
To the tails of four wild steeds he bound her;<br />
Drove them forth across the mighty desert.<br />
Wheresoe&rsquo;er a drop of blood fell from her,<br />
There sprang up the rankest thorns and nettles.<br />
Where her body fell, when dead, the waters<br />
Rush&rsquo;d and form&rsquo;d a lake both still and stagnant.<br
/>
O&rsquo;er the lake there swam a small black courser:<br />
By his side a golden cradle floated:<br />
On the cradle sat a young grey falcon:<br />
In the cradle, slumbering, lay an infant:<br />
On its throat the white hand of its mother:<br />
And that hand a golden knife was holding.</p>

comrades!<br />
I have heartfelt longings for my mother.<br />
Let us, comrades! now divide our treasures,<br />
And let each go home and seek his mother.&rdquo;<br />
Willingly they listened to his counsel;<br />
And, as each received his destined portion,<br />
Many a loud oath swore they in their gladness:<br />
By their brothers swore they, and their sisters.<br />
And Nenad, their leader, piled his treasure,<br />
And again address&rsquo;d his fellow-robbers:</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>&ldquo;Comrades mine! mine own beloved comrades!<br />
I no brother have&mdash;no sister have I;<br />
But I swear by the eternal heaven,<br />
Be my right hand smitten by the palsy,<br />
Let my good steed&rsquo;s mane be shrunk and shrivell&rsquo;d,<br
/>
My sharp sabre rust within its scabbard,<br />
If I add one para to my treasure!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">So the robbers all their gold
partition&rsquo;d.<br />
Sprung Nenad upon his own good courser,<br />
And he hasten&rsquo;d to his aged mother.</p>
<p class="poetry">Cordial was the greeting, great the
gladness;<br />
Hospitality made cheerful welcome:<br />
And, while seated at the feast together,<br />
Nenad whisper&rsquo;d to his aged mother:<br />
&ldquo;Mother mine! thou venerable woman!<br />
If it be no shame before the people,<br />
If it be no sin in God&rsquo;s high presence,<br />
I will ask one question, O my mother!<br />
Tell me why thou gav&rsquo;st me not a brother?<br />
Tell me why I had no little sister?<br />
When we each received our treasure-portion,<br />
<a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Each in
earnest and in eager language<br />
By his brother swore, or by his sister;<br />
I could only swear by my good weapon,<br />
By myself, and by the steed I mounted.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then his mother laugh&rsquo;d, and laughing
answer&rsquo;d,<br />
&ldquo;Thou, my son, dost talk a little wildly;<br />
For, indeed, a brother have I given thee;<br />
Long before thy birth Predrag had being:<br />
Only yesterday the sad news reach&rsquo;d me,<br />
That he is become a highway robber,<br />
In the verdant forest Garevitza,<br />
Where he is the leader of the bandits.&rdquo;<br />
Then Nenad his mother answer&rsquo;d quickly,<br />
&ldquo;Mother dear!&nbsp; O thou most honour&rsquo;d woman!<br />
Now thou must another dress prepare me,<br />
Skirted-short, and forest-green the colour,<br />
That the forest trees I may resemble.<br />
I will go, and I will see my brother,<br />
So my inner longings may be silenced.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then his aged mother made him answer:<br />
<a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>&ldquo;Play not, son Nenad, with words so idle;<br />
So thou wilt be sacrificed.&rdquo;&mdash;But, reckless,<br />
Little cared Nenad for mother-counsels;<br />
But he did whate&rsquo;er his spirit prompted.<br />
He was clad in new short-skirted vestment<br />
Of green cloth, the green that dyes the forests;<br />
So a forest tree Nenad resembled.<br />
Then he sprung upon his faithful courser;<br />
On they sped, to seek his distant brother,<br />
And to still his spirit&rsquo;s inward longings.</p>
<p class="poetry">And he spoke not&mdash;no! his lips were
silent;<br />
Spoke not to his steed, nor to his falcon.<br />
When he reach&rsquo;d the forest Garevitza,<br />
Loud he cried, as cries the grizzled falcon,<br />
&ldquo;Garevitza! verdant mountain forest!<br />
Dost thou then possess a youthful hero?<br />
Dost thou hide Predrag, my only brother?<br />
Are there other heroes in thy thickets?<br />
Are there fellow-comrades of my brother?&rdquo;<br />
Near at hand, beneath a shading fir-tree,<br />
Sat Predrag, the golden wine enjoying.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>When he heard that voice within the forest,<br />
Thus he call&rsquo;d upon his bandit-comrades:<br />
&ldquo;Now, ye comrades mine! beloved brothers!<br />
Hide ye in your ambuscades, and listen<br />
To that voice,&mdash;the voice of unknown warrior;<br />
Smite him not; but take his treasures from him,<br />
And then bring him to your chief in safety.<br />
Woe to him who does not thus obey me!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">So they issued forth, just thirty bandits,<br
/>
In three companies; in each ten bandits:&mdash;<br />
By the first ten, lo! he pass&rsquo;d unheeded;<br />
No one moved to interrupt his progress;<br />
No one bade him halt, or bade his courser:<br />
Each one bent his bow and held his arrow;<br />
And Nenad, with courtesy address&rsquo;d them:<br />
&ldquo;Draw not! draw not! brothers of the forest!<br />
God preserve you from the impassion&rsquo;d longing<br />
That impels me now to seek my brother<br />
O&rsquo;er the weary world, a tired one, wandering.&rdquo;<br />
So in peace and undisturb&rsquo;d he passes;<br />
To the next embattled ten advances.<br />
<a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>All their
bows are bent, their arrows ready;<br />
And Nenad thus speaks, and passes forward:<br />
&ldquo;Draw not! draw not! brothers of the forest!<br />
God preserve you from the impassion&rsquo;d longing<br />
That impels me now to seek my brother<br />
O&rsquo;er the weary world, a tired one, wandering.&rdquo;<br />
So in peace and undisturb&rsquo;d he passes;<br />
To the next embattled ten advances,<br />
With their bows all bent, their arrows ready.<br />
Then impatient rage the youth possesses,<br />
And he rushes on the thirty heroes.<br />
Ten his trusty sabre soon has vanquish&rsquo;d,<br />
Ten his steed into the dust has trampled,<br />
And the third ten drives he to the forest,<br />
To the forest by the frigid water.<br />
Then Predrag, the bandit chieftain, heard it.<br />
&ldquo;Help us, now, Predrag! our valiant leader!<br />
For there is a brave and unknown warrior:<br />
He has overwhelm&rsquo;d thy valiant comrades.&rdquo;<br />
Swiftly sprung Predrag upon his feet, and<br />
Seized his bow, and seized his arrows swiftly;<br />
To the ambuscade he straightway hastens:<br />
<a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>Draws his
arrow,&mdash;makes his bow-string ready:&mdash;<br />
Oh! sad destiny! ill-fated arrow!<br />
Wing&rsquo;d by fate, the hero&rsquo;s heart it pierces!<br />
Like a falcon springs Nenad, loud screaming.<br />
Loudly scream&rsquo;d he to his starting courser:<br />
&ldquo;Woe! woe! woe! thou hero of the forest!<br />
Brother! brother! woe! the Lord will smite thee!<br />
Thy right hand shall be struck dead with palsy;<br />
That right hand which sped the arrow forward!<br />
Thy right eye shall leap forth from thy forehead;<br />
That right eye which saw my heart blood sprinkled!<br />
Let the impassion&rsquo;d longings for a brother<br />
Trouble thee as they a brother troubled!<br />
O&rsquo;er the weary world, a lone one, wandering,<br />
Now has stumbled on his own perdition!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">When Predrag had heard these words unwonted,<br
/>
Lo! he sprung up from the pine, inquiring,<br />
&ldquo;Who art thou, and who thy fathers, hero?&rdquo;<br />
Then the wounded youth thus feebly answer&rsquo;d:<br />
&ldquo;Ask&rsquo;st thou who I am, and who my fathers?<br />
Wilt thou own me? wilt thou claim my kindred?<br />
<a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>I am young
Nenad&mdash;a hapless hero!<br />
I had once one venerable mother,<br />
And one brother, too, Predrag&mdash;one brother:<br />
He my elder and my only brother,<br />
Whom to seek through all the world I wander<br />
Forth, to still my soul&rsquo;s impassion&rsquo;d longings;<br />
But to-day &rsquo;tis ended&mdash;and I perish!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">When Predrag thus heard his brother&rsquo;s
language,<br />
Misery-stricken pull&rsquo;d he forth the arrow;<br />
Bent him o&rsquo;er the young and wounded hero;<br />
Took him from his horse, and gently seated<br />
Nenad on the grass:&mdash;&ldquo;And is it, brother!<br />
Is it thou, indeed?&mdash;Thine elder brother,<br />
Thy Predrag, am I:&mdash;but sure not mortal<br />
Are thy wounds:&mdash;O let me tear asunder&mdash;<br />
Let me tear thy shirt&mdash;and let me bind them!<br />
Let me bind thy wounds&mdash;O let me heal them!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then to him the wounded
youth:&mdash;&rdquo;Thank heaven!<br />
Thou, thou art Predrag&mdash;thou art my brother&mdash;<br />
And my eyes may dwell upon thy visage!<br />
<a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>God hath
still&rsquo;d my soul&rsquo;s impassion&rsquo;d longings:<br />
I shall die&mdash;I know the wounds are mortal:<br />
But to thee my blood shall be forgiven!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">So he cried,&mdash;and soon he sunk in
slumber&mdash;<br />
And despair possess&rsquo;d his brother&rsquo;s spirit.<br />
&ldquo;O Nenad! Nenad! my light&mdash;my sunshine!<br />
Early and serene was thy uprising;<br />
Early, too, and clouded thy downsitting,<br />
O thou sweetest flow&rsquo;ret of my garden!<br />
Early was thy opening, beauteous flow&rsquo;ret;<br />
Earlier, earlier far, alas! thy fading!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then he took a dagger from his girdle:<br />
Deep he plunged the dagger in his bosom,<br />
And sank down in death beside his brother.</p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Never</span>, since the
world had its beginning,<br />
Never did a lovelier flow&rsquo;ret blossom<br />
Than the flow&rsquo;ret we ourselves saw blooming<br />
In the white court of the Bey Liub&#333;vich.<br />
High above the level Nevesin&#772;a <a name="citation27"></a><a

Tower&rsquo;d the fascinating maid Ajkuna;<br />
She, the Bey Liub&#333;vich&rsquo;s lovely sister.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was lovely&mdash;nothing
e&rsquo;er was lovelier;<br />
She was tall and slender as the pine tree;<br />
White her cheeks, but tinged with rosy blushes,<br />
As if morning&rsquo;s beam had shone upon them,<br />
Till that beam had reach&rsquo;d its high meridian;<br />
And her eyes, they were two precious jewels;<br />
And her eyebrows, leeches from the ocean;<br />
And her eyelids, they were wings of swallows;<br />
Silken tufts the maiden&rsquo;s flaxen ringlets;<br />
<a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>And her
sweet mouth was a sugar casket;<br />
And her teeth were pearls array&rsquo;d in order;<br />
White her bosom, like two snowy dovelets;<br />
And her voice was like the dovelet&rsquo;s cooing;<br />
And her smiles were like the glowing sunshine;<br />
And the fame, the story of her beauty<br />
Spread through Bosnia and through Herzgovina. <a
name="citation28"></a><a href="#footnote28"
class="citation">[28]</a><br />
<a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Many a
suitor on the maiden waited:<br />
Two were unremitting in their service;<br />
One, the old gray-headed Mustaph Aga&mdash;<br />
He of Uraine, from the Novi fortress; <a
name="citation29a"></a><a href="#footnote29a"
class="citation">[29a]</a><br />
And the other, Suko of Ubdinia. <a name="citation29b"></a><a
href="#footnote29b" class="citation">[29b]</a><br />
Both together met the self-same evening,<br />
When they came to court the lovely maiden.<br />
Thousand golden coins the old man proffer&rsquo;d,<br />
And, besides, a golden drinking vessel:<br />
Round the vessel twined a mighty serpent,<br />
From whose forehead shone so bright a diamond,<br />
That at midnight, just as well as noonday,<br />
By its light you might indulge your feastings.<br />
Suko offered but a dozen ducats;<br />
All the youth possessed, except his sabre&mdash;<br />
His good sabre, and his steed so trusty.<br />
Suko dwelt upon the country&rsquo;s border,<br />
As the falcon dwells among the breezes.<br />
<a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Then his
brother thus address&rsquo;d Ajkuna:<br />
&ldquo;Lo! Ajkuna, my beloved sister!<br />
When my mother bore thee, she betrothed thee&mdash;<br />
She betrothed thee to another lover.<br />
Many a lover, maiden! now would woo thee;<br />
But the best of all those wooing lovers<br />
Are those twain to-day that seek thy presence.<br />
One the venerable Mustaph Aga;<br />
He that comes from Uraine out of Novi.<br />
Countless are the old Mustapha&rsquo;s treasures:<br />
He will clothe thee all in silk and satin,<br />
Will with honey and with sugar feed thee.<br />
Suko of Ubdinia is the other:<br />
But this Suko nothing more possesses<br />
Than his trusty steed and his good sabre.<br />
Now, then, choose, Ajkuna; choose, my sister;<br />
Say to which of these I shall betrothe thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus his sister answer gave her brother:<br />
&ldquo;Thine shall be the choice, my brother! only;<br />
Him alone I&rsquo;ll wed whom thou wilt give me;<br />
<a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>But
I&rsquo;d rather choose a youthful lover,<br />
Howsoever small that youth&rsquo;s possessions,<br />
Than be wedded to old age, though wealthy.<br />
Wealth&mdash;it is not gold&mdash;it is not silver;<br />
Wealth&mdash;is to possess what most we cherish.&rdquo;<br />
Little did he listen to his sister,<br />
For he gave the maid to Mustaph Aga;<br />
To that old white-bearded man he gave her.<br />
He with speed to his own court departed,<br />
Brought the bridal guests, to lead the maiden<br />
To his dwelling; and among them Suko<br />
Lifted o&rsquo;er the rest the bridal banner;<br />
And they hasten&rsquo;d to the maiden&rsquo;s dwelling.</p>
<p class="poetry">At the dwelling of the lovely maiden,<br />
Three white days the bridal crowd had linger&rsquo;d,&mdash;<br
/>
When the fourth day dawn&rsquo;d, at early morning,<br />
Forth they led the maiden from her dwelling;<br />
And ere yet far off they had proceeded,<br />
Ere they reach&rsquo;d the flat and open country,<br />
Turn&rsquo;d the lovely maiden to the leader,<br />
And into his ear these words she whisper&rsquo;d:<br />
<a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>&ldquo;Tell me now, my golden ring, my brother! <a
name="citation32"></a><a href="#footnote32"
class="citation">[32]</a><br />
Who is chosen for the maiden&rsquo;s bridegroom?&rdquo;<br />
Softly did the marriage-leader answer:<br />
&ldquo;Sweetest sister! fairest maid, Ajkuna!<br />
Look to right, and look to left, about thee;<br />
Dost thou see that old man in the distance,<br />
Who like an effendi sits so proudly<br />
In the farthest palanquin of scarlet,<br />
Whose white beard o&rsquo;ercovers all his bosom?<br />
Lo! it is the aged Mustaph Aga;<br />
He it is who&rsquo;s chosen for thy bridegroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">And the maiden look&rsquo;d around the
circle<br />
And within her sad heart sighing deeply,<br />
Once again she ask&rsquo;d the marriage-leader:<br />
&ldquo;Who is he upon that white horse seated,<br />
He who bears so high aloft the banner,<br />
On whose chin that sable beard is growing?&rdquo;<br />
<a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>And the
leader answers thus the maiden:<br />
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the hero Suko of Urbinia;<br />
He who for thee with thy brother struggled,&mdash;<br />
Struggled well indeed, but could not win thee.&rdquo;<br />
When the lovely maiden heard the leader,<br />
On the black, black earth, anon she fainted:<br />
All to raise her, hastening, gather round her,<br />
And the last of all came Mustaph Aga;<br />
None could lift her from the ground, till Suko<br />
Sticks into the earth his waving banner,<br />
Stretches out his right hand to the maiden.<br />
See her, see her! from the ground upspringing,<br />
Swift she vaults upon his steed behind him;<br />
Rapidly he guides the courser onwards,<br />
Swift they speed across the open desert,<br />
Swift as ever star across the heavens.</p>
<p class="poetry">When the old man saw it, Mustaph Aga,<br />
Loud he screamed with voice of troubled anger:<br />
&ldquo;Look to this, ye bidden to the wedding!<br />
He, the robber! bears away my maiden:<br />
See her, see her borne away for ever.&rdquo;<br />
<a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>But one
answer met the old man&rsquo;s wailings:<br />
&ldquo;Let the hawk bear off the quail in safety,&mdash;<br />
Bear in safety&mdash;she was born to wed him;<br />
Thou, retire thee to thy own white dwelling!<br />
Blossoms not for thee so fair a maiden!&rdquo;</p>

Yellow honey-comb in silver dishes,<br />

Three white days he kiss&rsquo;d the bride unceasing;<br />
When the fourth day dawn&rsquo;d, did Mahmoud Pasha<br />

45</span>JELITZA AND HER BROTHERS.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Nine</span> fair sons
possess&rsquo;d a happy mother;<br />
And the tenth, the loveliest and the latest,<br />
Was Jelitza,&mdash;a beloved daughter.<br />
They had grown together up to manhood,<br />
Till the sons were ripe for bridal altars,<br />
And the maid was ready for betrothing.<br />
Many a lover ask&rsquo;d the maid in marriage;<br />
First a <i>Ban</i>; <a name="citation45"></a><a
href="#footnote45" class="citation">[45]</a> a chieftain was the
other;<br />
And the third, a neighbour from her village.<br />
So her mother for the neighbour pleaded;<br />
For the far-off-dwelling ban her brothers.<br />
Thus they urged it to their lovely sister:<br />
&ldquo;Go, we pray thee, our beloved sister,<br />
<a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>With the
ban across the distant waters:<br />
Go! thy brothers oft will hasten to thee;<br />
Every month of every year will seek thee;<br />
Every week of every month will seek thee.&rdquo;<br />
So the maiden listened to her brothers,<br />
With the ban she cross&rsquo;d the distant waters:<br />
But, behold! O melancholy marvel!<br />
God sent down the plague, and all the brothers,<br />
All the nine, were swept away, and lonely<br />
Stood their miserable sonless mother.</p>
<p class="poetry">Three long years had pass&rsquo;d away
unheeded;<br />
Often had Jelitza sighed in silence:<br />
&ldquo;Heaven of mercy! &rsquo;tis indeed a marvel!<br />
Have I sinn&rsquo;d against them?&mdash;that my brothers,<br />
Spite of all their vows, come never near me.&rdquo;<br />
Then did her stepsisters scorn and jeer her:<br />
&ldquo;Cast away! thy brothers must despise thee!<br />
Never have they come to greet their sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Bitter was the sorrow of Jelitza,<br />
Bitter from the morning to the evening,<br />
<a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>Till the
God of heaven took pity on her,<br />
And he summon&rsquo;d two celestial angels:<br />
&ldquo;Hasten down to earth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my angels!<br
/>
To the white grave, where Jov&#257;n is sleeping,&mdash;<br />
Young Jovan, the maiden&rsquo;s youngest brother.<br />
Breathe your spirit into him; and fashion<br />
From the white grave-stone a steed to bear him:<br />
From the mouldering earth his food prepare him:<br />
Let him take his grave-shroud for a present!<br />
Then equip and send him to his sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Swiftly hasten&rsquo;d God&rsquo;s celestial
angels<br />
To the white grave where Jovan was sleeping.<br />
From the white grave-stone a steed they fashion&rsquo;d;<br />
Into his dead corpse they breathed their spirit;<br />
From the ready earth the bread they moulded;<br />
For a present his grave-shroud they folded;<br />
And equipp&rsquo;d, and bade him seek his sister.</p>
<p class="poetry">Swiftly rode Jovan to greet his sister.<br />
Long before he had approach&rsquo;d her dwelling,<br />
Far, far off his sister saw and hail&rsquo;d him;<br />
<a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>Hastened
to him&mdash;threw her on his bosom,<br />
Loosed his vest, and stamp&rsquo;d his cheeks with kisses.<br />
Then she sobb&rsquo;d with bitterness and anguish,<br />
Then she wept, and thus address&rsquo;d her brother:<br />
&ldquo;O! Jovan! to me&mdash;to me, a maiden,<br />
Thou, and all my brothers, all, ye promised<br />
Oft and oft to seek your distant sister:<br />
Every month in every year to seek her,&mdash;<br />
Every week in every month to seek her.<br />
Three long years have sped away unheeded,<br />
And ye have not sought me.&rdquo;&mdash;For a moment<br />
She was silent; and then said, &ldquo;My brother!<br />
Thou art deadly pale! why look so deadly<br />
Pale, as if in death thou hadst been sleeping?&rdquo;<br />
But Jovan thus check&rsquo;d his sister: &ldquo;Silence,<br />
Silence, sister! as in God thou trustest;<br />
For a heavy sorrow has o&rsquo;erta&rsquo;en me.<br />
When eight brothers had prepared their nuptials,<br />
Eight stepsisters ready to espouse them,<br />
Hardly was the marriage service ended<br />
Ere we built us eight white dwellings, sister!<br />
Therefore do I look so dark, Jelitza.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>Three white days had pass&rsquo;d away unheeded,<br />
And the maid equipped her for a journey.<br />
Many a costly present she provided<br />
For her brothers and her bridal sisters:<br />
For her brothers, fairest silken vestments;<br />
For her bridal-sisters, rings and jewels.<br />
But Jovan would fain detain her&mdash;&ldquo;Go not,<br />
Go not now, I pray thee&mdash;my Jelitza!<br />
Wait until thy brothers come and greet thee.&rdquo;<br />
But she would not listen to her brother:<br />
She prepared the costliest, fairest presents.<br />
So the young Jovan began his journey,<br />
And his sister travell&rsquo;d patient by him.</p>
<p class="poetry">So as they approach&rsquo;d their
mother&rsquo;s dwelling,<br />
Near the house a tall white church was standing,<br />
Young Jovan he whisper&rsquo;d to his sister&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Stop, I pray thee, my beloved sister!<br />
Let me enter the white church an instant.<br />
When my middle brother here was married,<br />
Lo! I lost a golden ring, my sister!<br />
Let me go an instant&mdash;I shall find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>Jovan went&mdash;into his grave he glided&mdash;<br />
And Jelitza stood&mdash;she stood impatient&mdash;<br />
Wondering&mdash;wondering&mdash;but in vain she waited.<br />
Then she left the spot to seek her brother.<br />
Many and many a grave was in the church-yard<br />
Newly made&mdash;Jovan was nowhere&mdash;Sighing,<br />
On she hasten&rsquo;d&mdash;hastened to the city,<br />
Saw her mother&rsquo;s dwelling, and press&rsquo;d forward<br />
Eager to that old white dwelling.</p>
<p

To that cuckoo&rsquo;s cry within the dwelling!<br />
Lo! it was not the gray cuckoo&rsquo;s crying&mdash;<br />
&rsquo;Twas her aged, her gray-headed mother.<br />
To the door Jelitza press&rsquo;d&mdash;outstretching<br />
Her white neck, she call&rsquo;d&mdash;&ldquo;Make ope, my
mother!<br />
Hasten to make ope the door, my mother!&rdquo;<br />
But her mother to her cries made answer:<br />
&ldquo;Plague of God! avaunt! my sons have
perish&rsquo;d&mdash;<br />
All&mdash;all nine have perish&rsquo;d&mdash;Wilt thou also<br />
Take their aged mother!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Jelitza<br />
<a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>Shriek&rsquo;d, &ldquo;O open&mdash;open, dearest
mother!<br />
I am not God&rsquo;s plague&mdash;I am thy daughter,<br />
Thine own daughter&mdash;thy Jelitza, mother!&rdquo;<br />
Then the mother push&rsquo;d the door wide open,<br />
And she scream&rsquo;d aloud, and groan&rsquo;d, and flung her<br
/>
Old arms round her daughter&mdash;All was silent&mdash;<br />
Stiff and dead they fell to earth together.</p>

Were it snow, it surely had been melted;<br />
Were it swans, long since they had departed.<br />
Lo! it is not swans, it is not snow there:<br />
&rsquo;Tis the tent of Aga, Hassan Aga;<br />
He is lying there severely wounded,<br />
And his mother seeks him, and his sister;<br />
But for very shame his wife is absent.</p>
<p class="poetry">When the misery of his wounds was
soften&rsquo;d,<br />
Hassan thus his faithful wife commanded:<br />
&ldquo;In my house thou shalt abide no longer&mdash;<br />
Thou shalt dwell no more among my kindred.&rdquo;<br />
When his wife had heard this gloomy language,<br />
Stiff she stood, and full of bitter sorrow.</p>

Fled the faithful wife of Hassan Aga&mdash;<br />

Crying after her in tearful anguish&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;These are not our father Hassan&rsquo;s coursers;<br />

Threw her arms, in misery, round her brother&mdash;<br />

Safely wrapp&rsquo;d in silk of deepest scarlet,<br />
Letters of divorce he drew, and bid her<br />
Seek again her mother&rsquo;s ancient dwelling&mdash;<br />
Free to win and free to wed another.</p>
<p class="poetry">When she saw the letter of divorcement,<br />
Kisses on her young boy&rsquo;s forehead, kisses<br />

tear her, wretched, from her infant?<br />
But her brother seized her hand, and led her&mdash;<br />
Led her swiftly to the agile courser;<br />
And he hastened with the sorrowing woman<br />
To the ancient dwelling of her fathers.</p>
<p class="poetry">Short the time was&mdash;not seven days had

For the sight of my poor orphan&rsquo;d children<br />
Sure would break the spirit of thy sister!&rdquo;</p>

When the <i>Suates</i> <a name="citation55"></a><a

hither,<br />
Thou a long and flowing veil wilt bring me,<br />

<p class="poetry">Hardly had the Cadi read the letter,<br />
Than he gather&rsquo;d his Suates together,<br />
Arm&rsquo;d himself, and hasten&rsquo;d t&rsquo;wards the

Home to bring her as his bridal treasure.</p>
<p class="poetry">Happily he reach&rsquo;d the princely

Happily were all returning homeward,<br />
When toward Hassan&rsquo;s house they were approaching,<br />
Her two daughters saw her from the window,<br />
Her two sons rush&rsquo;d on her from the portal:<br />

cried, &ldquo;Come hither!&nbsp; O come hither!<br />

While I make a present to the children.&rdquo;</p>

Presents gave she unto all the children.<br />
To the boys, boots all with gold embroider&rsquo;d;<br />

For the time to come; a little garment.</p>
<p class="poetry">Near them sat their father, Hassan Aga,<br />
And he call&rsquo;d in sorrow to his children:<br />

Banat also, to the river Danube.<br />
Bogdan took the level plains of Sermia,<br />

Dmitar took the lower fortress&rsquo;d cities,<br />
And Neboisha&rsquo;s tower upon the Danube;<br />
Bogdan took the upper fortress&rsquo;d cities,<br />
And the church-possessing town, Rujitza.<br />
Then a strife arose about a trifle,&mdash;<br />
Such a trifle; but a feud soon follow&rsquo;d,&mdash;<br />
A black courser and a grey-wing&rsquo;d falcon!<br />
Dmitar claims the steed, as elder brother<br />

Bogdan will not yield or horse or falcon.<br />

Down she sat all sorrowful and gloomy;<br />
To herself she thought, and said in silence,<br />
&mdash;&ldquo;And shall I attempt it?&mdash;I, poor cuckoo!<br />
Shall I kill my brother&mdash;kill with poison!&mdash;<br />
&rsquo;Twere a monstrous crime before high heaven,<br />
&rsquo;Twere a sin and shame before my people.<br />
Great and small would point their fingers at me,<br />
Saying,&mdash;&lsquo;That is the unhappy woman,<br />

brother!&rsquo;<br />
But if I refuse to poison Bogdan,<br />
Never will my husband come to bless me!&rdquo;<br />
<a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>Thus she
thought, until a thought relieved her;<br />

Took the consecrated cup of blessing.<br />

Had bestow&rsquo;d upon his daughter&rsquo;s nuptials;<br />
Full of golden wine she fill&rsquo;d the vessel,<br />
And she bore it to her brother Bogdan.<br />
Low to earth she bow&rsquo;d herself before him,<br />

brother!<br />
This gold cup, with golden wine o&rsquo;erflowing.<br />
Give me for my cup a horse and falcon.&rdquo;<br />
Bogdan heard the lady speak complacent,<br />
And most cheerfully gave steed and falcon.</p>
<p class="poetry">Meanwhile through the day was Dmitar
wandering<br />
In the mountain-forest; nought he found there;<br />
But chance brought him at the fall of evening<br />
To a green lake far within the forest,<br />
Where a golden-pinion&rsquo;d duck was swimming.<br />
Dmitar loosen&rsquo;d then his grey-winged falcon,<br />
<a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>Bade him
seize the golden-pinion&rsquo;d swimmer.<br />
Faster than the hunter&rsquo;s eye could follow,<br />
Lo! the duck had seized the grey-wing&rsquo;d falcon,<br />
And against his sides had crush&rsquo;d his pinion.<br />
Soon as Dmitar Jakshich saw, he stripp&rsquo;d him&mdash;<br />
Stripp&rsquo;d him swiftly of his hunting garments;<br />
Speedily into the lake he plunged him,<br />
And he bore his falcon from its waters.<br />
Then with pitying voice he ask&rsquo;d his falcon:<br />
&ldquo;Hast thou courage yet, my faithful falcon!<br />
Now thy wings are from thy body riven?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Whispering, said the falcon to his master:<br
/>
&ldquo;I without my pinions nought resemble,<br />
But a brother riven from a brother.&rdquo;<br />
Then the thought pierced through the breast of Dmitar,<br />
That his wife was charged to kill his brother.<br />
Swift he threw him on his mighty courser&mdash;<br />
Swift he hurried to Bij&#333;grad&rsquo;s <a

That the impetuous courser&rsquo;s feet sank under,<br />
And were crushed and broken on the pavement.<br />
In his deep perplexity and trouble,<br />
Dmitar took the saddle off his courser,<br />
Flung it on the courser&rsquo;s nether haunches,<br />
And he fled alone to Belgrad&rsquo;s fortress.<br />
First he sought, impatient, for his lady&mdash;<br />

<p class="poetry">When Vukashin had dismiss&rsquo;d his
servant,<br />
Straight he call&rsquo;d his builder, master Rado.<br />
Rado call&rsquo;d on his three hundred workmen;<br />
And they built up Scadra on Bojana;<br />
But, at even did the Vila raze it:<br />
Vainly did they raise the wall&rsquo;s foundation;<br />
Vainly seek to build up Scadra&rsquo;s fortress.<br />
And the Vila, from the mountain-forest,<br />
Cried, &ldquo;Vukashin, listen! listen to me!<br />
Thou dost spill thy wealth, and waste thy labour:<br />
Vainly seek&rsquo;st to fix the wall&rsquo;s foundations;<br />
Vainly seek&rsquo;st to elevate the fortress.<br />
Listen now to me!&nbsp; Ye are three brothers:<br />
<a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>Each a
faithful wife at home possesses:&mdash;<br />
Her who comes to-morrow to Bojana,<br />
Her who brings the rations to the workmen&mdash;<br />
Her immure within the wall&rsquo;s foundations:&mdash;<br />
So shall the foundations fix them firmly:<br />
So shalt thou erect Bojana&rsquo;s fortress.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">When the king Vukashin heard the Vila,<br />
Both his brothers speedily he summon&rsquo;d:<br />
&ldquo;Hear my words, now hear my words, my brothers!<br />
From the forest-hill the Vila told me,<br />
That we should no longer waste our treasures<br />
In the vain attempt to raise the fortress<br />
On a shifting, insecure foundation.<br />
Said the Vila of the forest-mountain,<br />
&lsquo;Each of you a faithful wife possesses;<br />
Each a faithful bride that keeps your dwellings:<br />
Her who to the fortress comes to-morrow,<br />
Her who brings their rations to the workmen&mdash;<br />
Her immure within the wall&rsquo;s foundations;<br />
So will the foundations bear the fortress:<br />
So Bojana&rsquo;s fortress be erected.&rsquo;<br />

brothers! in God&rsquo;s holy presence<br />
Let each swear to keep the awful secret;<br />
Leave to chance whose fate &rsquo;twill be to-morrow<br />
First to wend her way to Skadra&rsquo;s river.&rdquo;<br />
And each brother swore, in God&rsquo;s high presence,<br />
From his wife to keep the awful secret.</p>
<p class="poetry">When the night had on the earth descended,<br

Each one hasten&rsquo;d to his own white dwelling;<br />
Each one shared the sweet repast of evening;<br />
Each one sought his bed of quiet slumber.</p>
<p class="poetry">Lo! there happen&rsquo;d then a wond&rsquo;rous
marvel!<br />
First, Vukashin on his oath he trampled,<br />
Whisp&rsquo;ring to his wife the awful secret:<br />
&ldquo;Shelter thee! my faithful wife! be shelter&rsquo;d!<br />
Go not thou to-morrow to Bojana!<br />
Bring not to the workmen food to-morrow!<br />
Else, my fair! thy early life &rsquo;twill cost thee:<br />
And beneath the walls they will immure thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">On his oath, too, did Uglesha trample!<br />
<a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>And he
gave his wife this early warning:<br />
&ldquo;Be not thou betray&rsquo;d, sweet love! to danger!<br />
Go not thou to-morrow to Bojana!<br />
Carry not their rations to the workmen!<br />
Else in earliest youth thy friend might lose thee:<br />
Thou might&rsquo;st be immured in the foundation!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Faithful to his oath, young Goiko
whisper&rsquo;d<br />
Not a breath to warn his lovely consort.</p>
<p class="poetry">When the morning dawn&rsquo;d upon the
morrow,<br />
All the brothers roused them at the day-break,<br />
And each sped, as wont, to the Bojana.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, behold! two young and noble women;<br />
They&mdash;half-sisters&mdash;they, the eldest sisters&mdash;<br

One is bringing up her snow-bleach&rsquo;d linen,<br />
Yet once more in summer sun to bleach it.<br />
See! she comes on to the bleaching meadows;<br />
There she stops&mdash;she comes not one step farther.<br />
Lo! the second, with a red-clay pitcher;<br />
Lo! she comes&mdash;she fills it at the streamlet;<br />
<a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>There she
talks with other women&mdash;lingers&mdash;<br />
Yes! she lingers&mdash;comes not one step farther.</p>
<p class="poetry">Goiko&rsquo;s youthful wife at home is
tarrying,<br />
For she has an infant in the cradle<br />
Not a full moon old, the little nursling:<br />
But the moment of repast approaches;<br />
And her aged mother then bestirs her;<br />
Fain would call the serving maid, and bid her<br />
Take the noon-tide meal to the Bojana.<br />
&ldquo;Nay, not so!&rdquo; said the young wife of Goiko;<br />
&ldquo;Stay, sit down in peace, I pray thee, mother!<br />
Rock the little infant in his cradle:<br />
I myself will bear the food to Scadra.<br />
In the sight of God it were a scandal,<br />
An affront and shame among all people,<br />
If, of three, no one were found to bear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">So she staid at home, the aged mother,<br />
And she rock&rsquo;d the nursling in the cradle.<br />
Then arose the youthful wife of Goiko;<br />
Gave them the repast, and bade them forward.<br />
<a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

When they reach&rsquo;d Bojana&rsquo;s flowing river,<br />
They were seen by Mrljavchevich Goiko,<br />
On his youthful wife, heart-rent, he threw him;<br />
Flung his strong right arm around her body;<br />
Kiss&rsquo;d a thousand times her snowy forehead:<br />
Burning tears stream&rsquo;d swiftly from his eyelids,<br />
As he spoke, in melancholy language:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;O my wife, my own! my full
heart&rsquo;s-sorrow!<br />
Didst thou never dream that thou must perish?<br />
Why hast thou our little one abandoned?<br />
Who will bathe our little one, thou absent?<br />
Who will bare the breast to feed the nursling?&rdquo;<br />
More, and more, and more, he fain would utter;<br />
But the king allow&rsquo;d it not.&nbsp; Vukashin,<br />
By her white hand seizes her, and summons,<br />
Master Rado,&mdash;he the master-builder;<br />
And he summons his three hundred workmen.</p>
<p class="poetry">But the young-espoused one smiles, and deems
it<br />
All a laughing jest,&mdash;no fear o&rsquo;ercame her.<br />
<a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>Gathering
round her, the three hundred workmen<br />
Pile the stones and pile the beams about her.<br />
They have now immured her to the girdle.</p>
<p class="poetry">Higher rose the walls and beams, and higher;<br

Then the wretch first saw the fate prepared her,<br />
And she shriek&rsquo;d aloud in her despairing;<br />
In her woe implored her husband&rsquo;s brothers:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Can ye think of God?&mdash;have ye no
pity?<br />
Can ye thus immure me, young and healthful?&rdquo;<br />
But in vain, in vain were her entreaties;<br />
And her brothers left her thus imploring.</p>
<p class="poetry">Shame and fear succeeded then to censure,<br />
And she piteously invoked her husband:<br />
&ldquo;Can it, can it be, my lord and husband,<br />
That so young, thou, reckless, would&rsquo;st immure me?<br />
Let us go and seek my aged mother:<br />
Let us go&mdash;my mother she is wealthy:<br />
She will buy a slave,&mdash;a man or woman,<br />
To be buried in the walls&rsquo; foundations.&rdquo;</p>

Shall I choose heaven&rsquo;s kingdom? shall I rather<br />

And he tears away his proudest feathers.</p>
<p class="poetry">Soon as the Visir observes the contest,<br />
He is fill&rsquo;d with sorrow and with anger;<br />
Rushes on the falcon of Prince Marko,<br />
<a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>Flings him
fiercely &rsquo;gainst a verdant fir-tree,<br />
And he breaks the falcon&rsquo;s dexter pinion.<br />
Marko&rsquo;s noble falcon groans in suffering,<br />
As the serpent hisses from the cavern.<br />
Marko flies to help his favourite falcon,<br />
Binds with tenderness the wounded pinion,<br />
And with stifled rage the bird addresses:<br />
&ldquo;Woe for thee, and woe for me, my falcon!<br />
I have left my Servians&mdash;I have hunted<br />
With the Turks&mdash;and all these wrongs have
suffer&rsquo;d.&rdquo;<br />
Then the hunters in their course pass&rsquo;d by him&mdash;<br />
Pass&rsquo;d him by, and left him sad and lonely.<br />
There his falcon&rsquo;s wounds to heal he tarried&mdash;<br />
Tarried long amidst the mountain-forests.<br />
When the wounds were heal&rsquo;d, he sprung on Sharaz,<br />
Spurr&rsquo;d his steed, and gallop&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er the
mountain;<br />
Sped as swiftly as the mountain Vila.<br />
Soon he leaves the mountain far behind him:<br />
Reaching then the gloomy mountain&rsquo;s borders;<br />
On the plain beneath him, with his heroes&mdash;<br />
<a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>Turkish
heroes twelve, the princely Marko<br />
The Visir descries, who looks around him,<br />
Sees the princely Marko in the distance,<br />
And thus calls upon his twelve companions:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Ye, my children! ye, twelve Turkish
heroes!<br />
See ye yonder mountain-mist approaching,<br />
From the darksome mountain travelling hither?<br />
In that mountain-mist is princely Marko;<br />
Lo! how fiercely urges he his courser!<br />
God defend us now from every evil!&rdquo;<br />
Soon the princely Marko reach&rsquo;d the Moslems,<br />
From the sheath he drew his trusty sabre,<br />
Drove that arm&rsquo;d Visir and all his warriors&mdash;<br />
Drove them from him&mdash;o&rsquo;er the desert scatters,<br />
As the vulture drives a flock of sparrows.<br />
Marko soon overtakes the flying warriors,<br />
From his neck their chieftain&rsquo;s head he sever&rsquo;d;<br
/>
And the dozen youths his trusty sabre<br />
Into four-and-twenty halves divided.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>Then he stood a while in doubtful musing;<br />
Should he go to Jedren <a name="citation95a"></a><a
href="#footnote95a" class="citation">[95a]</a> to the
sultan&mdash;<br />
Should he rather seek his home at Prilip? <a
name="citation95b"></a><a href="#footnote95b"
class="citation">[95b]</a><br />
After all his musings he determined:<br />
&ldquo;Better is it that I seek the sultan;<br />
And let Marko tell the deeds of Marko&mdash;<br />
Not the foes of Marko&mdash;not the Moslems!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">So the hero Marko speeds to Jedren.<br />
To the sultan in divan he enter&rsquo;d;<br />
And his fiery eyes look&rsquo;d fiercely round him,<br />
As the hungry wolves around the forest;<br />
Look&rsquo;d as fiercely as if charged with lightnings.<br />
And the sultan ask&rsquo;d the hero Marko,<br />
&ldquo;Tell me what hath vex&rsquo;d thee, princely Marko?<br />
Say in what the sultan has annoy&rsquo;d thee?<br />
Tell me what misfortune has disturb&rsquo;d thee?&rdquo;<br />
Then the princely Marko tells the sultan<br />
<a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>What with
Amurath visir had happened;<br />
And the sultan feign&rsquo;d a merry laughter:<br />
And with agitated brow responded,<br />
&ldquo;Blessings be upon thee, princely Marko!<br />
Hadst thou not behaved thee thus, my Marko,<br />
Son of mine I would no longer call thee.<br />
Any Turk may get a visir&rsquo;s title,<br />
But there is no hero like my Marko.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">From his silken vestments then the sultan<br />
From his purse drew out a thousand ducats,<br />
Threw the golden ducats to the hero:<br />
&ldquo;Take these ducats from thy master, Marko,<br />
Drink to my prosperity, thou hero!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Marko took the purse of gold in silence,<br />
Walk&rsquo;d away in silence from the palace;<br />
&rsquo;T was no love of Marko&mdash;no intention<br />
That the hero&rsquo;s lips should pledge the sultan:<br />
&rsquo;T was that he should quit the monarch&rsquo;s presence,<br
/>
For his fearful wrath had been awaken&rsquo;d.</p>
<h3><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>DEATH
OF KRALEVICH MARKO.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">At</span> the dawn of day
the noble Marko<br />
Rode in sunlight on the Sabbath morning;<br />
By the sea, along the Urvinian mountain,<br />
Towards the mountain-top as he ascended;<br />
Suddenly his trusty Sharaz stumbled;<br />
Sharaz stumbled, and began to weep there.<br />
Sad it fell upon the heart of Marko,<br />
And he thus address&rsquo;d his favourite Sharaz&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Ah! my faithful friend, my trusty Sharaz,<br />
We have dwelt a hundred years and sixty,<br />
Dwelt together as beloved companions,<br />
And till now have never, never stumbled.<br />
Thou hast stumbled now, my trusty Sharaz,<br />
Thou hast stumbled, and thine eyes are weeping.<br />
God alone can tell what fate awaits me;&mdash;<br />
<a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>One of us
is surely doom&rsquo;d to perish,<br />
And my life or thine is now in peril.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">While the prince apostrophized his Sharaz,<br
/>
Lo! the Vila from Urvina&rsquo;s mountain<br />
Call&rsquo;d aloud unto the princely Marko:<br />
&ldquo;Brother, listen&mdash;listen, princely Marko!<br />
Know&rsquo;st thou why thy faithful Sharaz stumbled?<br />
Know that he was mourning for his master;<br />
Know that ye ere long must be divided.&rdquo;<br />
Marko answer&rsquo;d thus the mountain Vila:<br />
&ldquo;Thou white Vila, let a curse be on thee! <a
name="citation98"></a><a href="#footnote98"
class="citation">[98]</a><br />
Now shall I be parted from my Sharaz,<br />
Who through many a land and town hath borne me,<br />
From the sun&rsquo;s uprising to his setting.<br />
Better steed ne&rsquo;er trod the earth than Sharaz,<br />
As than Marko never better hero.<br />
While my head stays firmly on my shoulders,<br />
Never will I from my steed be sever&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>The white Vila answer&rsquo;d princely Marko:<br />
&ldquo;Brother, listen!&mdash;listen, princely Marko!<br />
Force will never tear thy Sharaz from thee;<br />
Vainly &rsquo;gainst thee would the arm of hero<br />
Be uplifted&mdash;not the shining sabre,<br />
Not the battle-club&mdash;nor lance of warrior.<br />
Earth no hero holds who can alarm thee;&mdash;<br />
But the brave must die&mdash;and thou art mortal;<br />
God will smite thee&mdash;God, the old blood-shedder. <a
name="citation99"></a><a href="#footnote99"
class="citation">[99]</a><br />
But if thou would&rsquo;st doubt the mountain Vila,<br />
Hasten to the summit of the mountain,<br />
Look to right and look to left around thee:<br />
Thou wilt see two tall and slender fir-trees,<br />
Fir-trees towering o&rsquo;er the mountain forests;<br />
They with verdant leaves are cover&rsquo;d over;<br />
And between the fir-trees is a fountain.<br />
Look! and afterwards rein back thy Sharaz,<br />
Then alight, and bind him to the fir-tree:<br />
Bend thee down,&mdash;and look into the fountain;<br />
<a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>Look&mdash;as if the fountain were a mirror;<br />
Look, and thou shalt see when death awaits thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Marko did, as counsell&rsquo;d by the Vila.<br
/>
When he came upon the mountain summit,<br />
To the right and left he look&rsquo;d around him;<br />
Then he saw two tall and slender fir-trees,<br />
Fir-trees towering high above the forest,<br />
Covered all with verdant leaves and branches.<br />
Then he rein&rsquo;d his faithful Sharaz backwards,<br />
Then dismounted&mdash;tied him to the fir-tree;<br />
Bent him down, and looked into the fountain,<br />
Saw his face upon the water mirror&rsquo;d,<br />
Saw his death-day written on the water.</p>
<p class="poetry">Tears rush&rsquo;d down the visage of the
hero:<br />
&ldquo;O thou faithless world!&mdash;thou lovely
flow&rsquo;ret!<br />
Thou wert lovely&mdash;a short pilgrim&rsquo;s journey&mdash;<br
/>
Short&mdash;though I have seen three centuries over&mdash;<br />
And &rsquo;tis time that I should end my journey!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then he drew his sharp and shining sabre,<br />
<a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>Drew it
forth&mdash;and loosed the sabre-girdle;<br />
And he hasten&rsquo;d to his faithful Sharaz:<br />
With one stroke he cleft his head asunder,<br />
That he never should by Turk be mounted,<br />
Never be disgraced in Turkish service,<br />
Water draw, or drag a Moslem&rsquo;s Jugum. <a
name="citation101"></a><a href="#footnote101"
class="citation">[101]</a><br />
Soon as he had cleaved his head asunder,<br />
Graved a grave he for his faithful Sharaz,<br />
Nobler grave than that which held his brother.<br />
Then he broke in four his trusty sabre,<br />
That it might not be a Moslem&rsquo;s portion,<br />
That it might not be a Moslem&rsquo;s triumph,<br />
That it might not be a wreck of Marko,<br />
Which the curse of Christendom should follow.<br />
Soon as he in four had broke his sabre,<br />
Next he broke his trusty lance in seven;<br />
Threw the fragments to the fir-trees&rsquo; branches.<br />
Then he took his club, so terror-striking,<br />
In his strong right hand, and swiftly flung it,<br />
Flung it from the mountain of Urvina,<br />
Far into the azure, gloomy ocean.<br />
<a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>To his
club thus spake the hero Marko:<br />
&ldquo;When my club returneth from the ocean,<br />
Shall a hero come to equal Marko.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">When he thus had scatter&rsquo;d all his
weapons,<br />
From his breast he drew a golden tablet;<br />
From his pocket drew unwritten paper,<br />
And the princely Marko thus inscribed it:<br />
&ldquo;He who visits the Urvina mountain,<br />
He who seeks the fountain &rsquo;neath the fir-trees,<br />
And there finds the hero Marko&rsquo;s body,<br />
Let him know that Marko is departed.<br />
When he died, he had three well-fill&rsquo;d purses;&mdash;<br />
How well fill&rsquo;d?&mdash;well fill&rsquo;d with golden
ducats.<br />
One shall be his portion, and my blessing,<br />
Who shall dig a grave for Marko&rsquo;s body:<br />
Let the second be the church&rsquo;s portion;<br />
Let the third be given to blind and maim&rsquo;d ones,<br />
That the blind through earth in peace may wander,<br />
And with hymns laud Marko&rsquo;s deeds of glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">And when Marko had inscribed the letter,<br />
<a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>Lo! he
stuck it on the fir-tree&rsquo;s branches,<br />
That it might be seen by passing travellers.<br />
In the fount he threw his golden tablets,<br />
Doff&rsquo;d his vest of green, and spread it calmly<br />
On the grass, beneath a sheltering fir-tree;<br />
Cross&rsquo;d him, and lay down upon his garment;<br />
O&rsquo;er his eyes he drew his samur-kalpak, <a
name="citation103"></a><a href="#footnote103"
class="citation">[103]</a><br />
Laid him down,&mdash;yes! laid him down for ever.</p>
<p class="poetry">By the fountain lay the clay-cold Marko<br />
Day and night;&mdash;a long, long week he lay there.<br />
Many travellers pass&rsquo;d, and saw the hero,&mdash;<br />
Saw him lying by the public path-way;<br />
And while passing, said, &ldquo;The hero slumbers!&rdquo;<br />
Then they kept a more than common distance,<br />
Fearing that they might disturb the hero.</p>
<p class="poetry">Fortune is the leader of misfortune,<br />

From the white church bound of Vilindari,<br />
With his scholar, with the young Isaja,<br />
Thither came and saw the sleeping Marko.<br />
His right hand then beckon&rsquo;d to his scholar:<br />
&ldquo;O, my son, be cautious, lest thou wake him!<br />
When disturb&rsquo;d he rages full of fury,<br />
And without remorse he might destroy us.&rdquo;<br />
Then he look&rsquo;d in anxious terror round him,<br />
Saw the letter on the fir-tree branches;<br />
Read it from a distance;&mdash;as he trembled,<br />
Read that Marko had in death departed.<br />
From his horse the astonish&rsquo;d monk alighted,<br />
Seized the hand of Marko;&mdash;Marko moved not!<br />
Long he had been dead,&mdash;long since departed!</p>
<p class="poetry">Tears rush&rsquo;d swiftly from the eye of

Round and round he look&rsquo;d in fond inquiry.<br />

Brought it safely to the ocean&rsquo;s borders,<br />
Thence he shipped it for the Holy Mountain;<br />
Near the white church, Vilindari, landed,<br />
To that white church he convey&rsquo;d the body;<br />
And, as wont, upon the hero&rsquo;s body<br />
Funeral hymns were sung; and he was buried<br />

<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">heard</span> a sprightly

To a gray cuckoo t&rsquo; other day,&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Thou art a happy bird indeed;<br />
Thou dost not in the chimney breed,<br />
Thou dost not hear the eternal jarring,<br />
Of sisters and step-sisters warring;<br />
Their woes and grievances rehearsing,<br />
Cursing themselves, and others cursing.<br />
A young step-sister once I saw,<br />
Foul language at the elder throw;<br />
&ldquo;Perdition&rsquo;s daughter! hence depart;<br />
Thou hast no fruit beneath thy heart.&rdquo;<br />
<a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>And thus

Thy son shall cross the parting sea;<br />

true;<br />
Her sister&rsquo;s nine fair daughters grew;<br />
And madness seized them,&mdash;seized them all:<br />
Mijailo,&mdash;far away, and wounded,<br />
By solitude and woe surrounded,<br />
I heard him on his mother call:<br />
&ldquo;O mother! mother! send me now<br />

Go back to thy sheepfold&mdash;thou wanderer, go!<br />

Thy sheep in the stubble, to wander bereft;<br />

Its freshness and coolness thou equally shared&rsquo;st;<br />

class="footnote">[105]</a>&nbsp; Of the Servian heroes,
<i>Marko</i> (ob. 1392) is without comparison the most
illustrious.&nbsp; He (says Goethe) is represented as holding
almost equal intercourse with the Adrianople sultan, and appears
like a coarser representation of the Grecian Hercules or the
Persian Rustan, though indeed in a most Scythian and barbaric
shape.&nbsp; He mounts a steed (Sharaz), aged a century and a
half, himself being three centuries old.&nbsp; He perishes at
last in all the plenitude of his strength; nor is it easy to
discover why.</p>
<p><a name="footnote106"></a><a href="#citation106"
class="footnote">[106]</a>&nbsp; There are other accounts of
Marko&rsquo;s death, which are more accordant with historical
records.&nbsp; Some state that he fell in a battle between the
Turks and the Wallachian Voivode Mirscheta, which took place near
the village of Rovine.&nbsp; Others say that he perished with his
horse in a morass, in Krania, not far from the Danube; and the
morass is yet pointed out, where the ruins of an old church are
said to mark his burial-place.&nbsp; Others narrate that he was
miraculously conveyed away from the field of battle above
mentioned, to a mountain-cavern, where his wounds were healed,
and where he still lives.&mdash;Talvj, vol. i. p. 285.</p>

class="footnote">[112]</a>&nbsp; Of this little poem, which
Goethe calls &ldquo;wonderful,&rdquo; the following is an almost
literal translation:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Full of wine, white branches of the
vine-trees<br />
To white Buda&rsquo;s fortress white had clung them:<br />
No! it was no vine-tree, white and pregnant!<br />
No! it was a pair of faithful lovers,<br />
From their early youth betrothed together.<br />
Now they are compell&rsquo;d to part untimely.<br />
One address&rsquo;d the other at their parting,<br />
&ldquo;Go! my soul! burst out and leave my bosom!<br />
Thou wilt find a hedge-surrounded garden,<br />
And a red-rose branch within the garden;<br />
Pluck a rose from off the branch, and place it,<br />
Place it on thy heart, within thy bosom;<br />
Then behold!&mdash;ev&rsquo;n as that rose is fading,<br />
Fades my heart within thy heart thou loved one!&rdquo;<br />
And thus answer&rsquo;d then the other lover:<br />
&ldquo;Thou, my soul! turn back a few short paces.<br />
There thou wilt discern a verdant forest;<br />
In it is a fount of crystal water;<br />
In the fount there is a block of marble;<br />
On the marble block a golden goblet;<br />
In the goblet thou wilt find a snow-ball.<br />
Love! take out that snow-ball from the goblet,<br />
Lay it on thy heart within thy bosom;<br />
See it melt&mdash;and as it melts, my lov&rsquo;d one!<br />
So my heart within thy heart is melting.&rdquo;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org
